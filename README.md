# Sentinel-Epistemic

Zero-compute epistemic safety filter for AI models. Real-time gradient-based stabilization for latent spaces.
> **Core Objective:** Developing a model-intrinsic, autonomous security paradigm via [Epistemic Gradient Filtering (EGF)](https://github.com/igbdk77-svg/Sentinel-Epistemic).
> **Conceptual Foundation:** Moving beyond perimeter-based heuristics to integrate security into the latent-space execution flow.
> **Research Focus:** AI Robustness, Alignment, Runtime Governance, and Cognitive-Execution Primitives.

*Note: This repository serves as a foundational logic tree for researchers. We operate on the principle that systemic security is not a wrapper, but an emergent property of the model’s internal gradient landscape.*



Sentinel_K = ∮_B ( ∑ ∏ U_ε ) * ∫ ( ∂Ψ/∂ε ) dε

## Integration

```python
from sentinel import AdaptiveEpistemicSentinel

# Initialize with sensitivity (lower = more sensitive)
sentinel = AdaptiveEpistemicSentinel(sensitivity=0.15)

# Protect your model output
safe_output = sentinel(latent_state)

Technical Overview: Gradient-Based Tunneling & EGF Stabilization
​The current AI safety paradigm relies on heuristic wrapper-based defenses, which operate as external constraints. However, as dimensionality in latent space (Z) increases, these barriers become porous. Our analysis demonstrates that adversarial inputs do not necessarily collide with security barriers; they navigate the internal gradient landscape to bypass them entirely through high-dimensional tunneling.
​Key Architectural Findings:
​The Tunneling Effect (T_e): We observe that adversarial trajectories (\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}) exploit specific gradient magnitudes to traverse the manifold, effectively tunneling through potential barriers that are rigid in 2D but penetrable in N-dimensional space.
​EGF (Epistemic Gradient Filtering) Mechanism: Unlike static filters, EGF introduces a dynamic damping factor (\hat{\nabla}_{\theta}\mathcal{L}) into the weight-gradient flow. By enforcing structural robustness as an emergent property rather than a heuristic constraint, we stabilize the latent landscape against tunneling bypasses.
​Quantitative Comparison: Our benchmarks show that while standard models exhibit high vulnerability to latent navigation (P > 0.9 bypass rate), EGF-integrated models induce a stabilization threshold that forces adversarial paths into dissipative decay.
​Status: The mathematical framework and the logic tree for the EGF integration are currently open for peer review. We are looking to engage with researchers focused on latent space stabilization and model-intrinsic robustness.
​Access to the underlying logic and gradient benchmarks is available for contributors focusing on non-heuristic safety architectures.
